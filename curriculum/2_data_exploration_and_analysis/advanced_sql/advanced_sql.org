* Before we start

** The notes

The code is located in:  [[http://bit.ly/2xBBQ5b][http://bit.ly/2xBBQ5b]]

** Test your connection

If you are using =psql= use the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
psql postgresql://attendee:dssg_conference_2017@advanced-sql.dssg.io:80/dssg_conference
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you are using a graphical client:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE yaml
  host: advanced-sql.dssg.io
  port: 80
  username: attendee
  password: dssg_conference_2017
  db: dssg_conference
#+END_EXAMPLE

* The punchline

Databases are not only for *storage* they are for manipulating in an
efficient way your data: Try to do the data manipulation near to where
the data is located.

* The food inspections data set

The data represents the inspections made in different facilities in
the area of Chicago.

There are different types of inspections, different types of
facilities and different results (or outcomes) of that
inspections. Also the data contains the
types of violations and text descriptions in free form about the
violations.

Obviously, we have spatio-temporal data (i.e. the inspections happen
in a given time at some place).

* Some basic tasks in a data analysis project

- Cleaning the data
- Manipulating the data
- Create new /FeatureS/
- Create new views of the data
- Answering analytical questions

* Cleaning and manipulating the data

We already prepared a partial "cleaning" of the data. That data is
located in the =schema= =cleaned=.

** Hands-on

Expected time: 2 minutes

Feel the data:
- How many tables are there?
- Which are the respective columns?
- How many rows per table?
- Any idea about how to join them?
- Look at the inspection =2078651,= How many violations does it had?

Let's move on, for most of the analytical purposes (related to data
science) we need a consolidated view of the entities in our data,
i.e. we need to /denormalize/ the data. We will call to this new table
the /semantic/ view of the data.

If we do a simple join between this two tables, we will get many
rows per inspection. And that will complicate our future analysis. So
we need a way of collapse those rows, without losing data.

* Manipulating the data: JSON

=PostgreSQL= supports collapsing several rows using [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/functions-array.html][arrays]] or [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-json.html][JSON]].
We will transform the rows of the =cleaned.violations= table into =json=
and we will aggregate those into a =json array=.

We will do this together using the functions  =row_to_json= and =json_agg.=

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
         json_agg(
          row_to_json(v.*)
         ) as violations
  from cleaned.violations as v
  where inspection  = '2078651'
#+END_SRC

We could improve the output (make it more pretty) using the function =json_build_object=, and
a simple =group by=

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
          v.inspection,
          v.license_num,
          v.date,
          json_agg(
                   json_build_object('code',v.violation_code,
                                     'description', v.violation_description,
                                     'comment',v.violation_comment)
          ) as violations
  from cleaned.violations as v
  where inspection  = '2078651'
  group by v.inspection, v.license_num, v.date  -- We need a group by since we are using an aggregator function
#+END_SRC

** Hands-on
 Estimated time: 1 minute
 Manipulate the previous query statement
 and try to join it with the inspections (You should get
 only one row)


* Cleaning your code and (maybe) gaining a little speed: CTEs

It is very probable that you use a sub-query in you previous hands-on.

There is a better way of doing it, and is using [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html][Common Table Expressions (CTEs)]]
also know as /WITH queries/.

This will improve your readability (be nice wih the future you!) and in some cases speed
improvements

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  -- You first define your subquery and assign a name to it
  -- This will work as a "common table"
  with violations as (
       select
          v.inspection,
          v.license_num,
          v.date,
          json_agg(
                  json_build_object('code',v.violation_code,
                                    'description', v.violation_description,
                                    'comment',v.violation_comment)
          ) as violations
        from cleaned.violations as v
        group by v.inspection, v.license_num, v.date
  )

  -- Then you can use it

  select i.*, v.violations
  from cleaned.inspections as i
  left join violations as v -- Here we are using the "common table"
  using (inspection)
#+END_SRC

You can use several CTEs, just remove all except the first =with= and
separate them by colons. We will show you more examples later in this workshop.

* Querying unstructured data

We created for you the table =semantic.inspections=, and is very similar
to the results of your last hands-on.

For querying =json= unstructured data, PostgreSQL provides you with the
operator =->>=. This operator /extracts/ the *value* of the *key* in the json.

We first need to transform the array of =json= objects (/unnest/ it) into
rows (using =jsonb_array_elements=, and
then use the operator =->>= for retrieving the value of the specified
key.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  with violations as (
       select
          inspection,
          jsonb_array_elements(violations) as violations -- This returns several rows
       from semantic.inspections
       where inspection = '104246'
  )

  select inspection,
         violations ->> 'code' as violation_code, -- We want the value of the key 'code'
         count(*)
  from violations
  group by inspection, violation_code

#+END_SRC

** Hands-on
   Estimated time: 2 minutes
   Modify this query to get the facility (using =license_num=) in which the
   inspectors found the biggest number of violation code 40.


* "Datawarehousing"

Generate data for a BI dashboard, that shows all total number of
inspections, and their results,
per city, facility type, month, year including totals and subtotals

** Hands-on
   Estimated time: 2 minutes
   How to solve this using basic sql?

** Datawarehousing functions

=PostgreSQL= overloaded the operator =GROUP BY=, so besides their normal
use, now you can produce reports of aggregation metrics by sets
(=GROUPING SETS=),
hierarchy (=ROLLUP=) and combinations (=CUBE=) in a simple query.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  -- This doesn't give you the subtotals and totals
  select
          month,
          year,
          city,
          facility_type,
          results,
          count(*) as number_of_inspections
  from semantic.inspections
  where year = 2017 and month = 1
  group by month, year, city, facility_type, results
  --group by GROUPING SETS (month, year, city, facility_type, results, ())
  --group by ROLLUP (month, year, city, facility_type, results)
  --group by CUBE (month, year, city, facility_type, results)
#+END_SRC

** Hands-on
   Estimated time: 5 minutes
   Play with the different commented lines in the example query, if
   you only one the subtotal per =facility_type= and =city=, Which one
   you should use?


* Analytical Questions: Looking through the window

How do each facility' number of inspections compares to others in
their facility type? Total of inspections? Average of inspections?
Distance to the top? Distance from the average? How percentage of
inspections where used in a particular facility?

** Hands-on:
   Estimated time: 5 minutes
   Try to solve this by yourself using only =SELECT=, =GROUP BY=, =HAVING=, =WHERE=


* Analytical Questions: Looking through the window


** Window functions

 - They are similar to aggregate functions, but instead of operating on
   groups of rows to produce a single row, they act on rows related to
   the current row to produce the same amount of rows.
 - There are several [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-window.html][window functions]]
   like =row_number=, =rank=, =ntile=, =lag=, =lead=, =first_value=, =last_value=,
   =nth_value=.
 - And you can use any aggregation functions: =sum=, =count=, =avg=, etc
 - Those functions are used in [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS][window function calls]].


#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  with failures_per_facility as (
  select
          license_num,
          facility,
          facility_type,
          year,
          count(*) as inspections
  from semantic.inspections
  where year = 2015 and facility_type is not null
  group by license_num, facility, facility_type, year
  )

  select
          year,license_num,facility,facility_type,
          inspections,
          sum(inspections) over w1 as "total inspections per type",
          100*(inspections::decimal/sum(inspections) over w1)::numeric(18,1)  as "% of inspections",
          (avg(inspections) over w1)::numeric(18,3) as "avg inspections per type",
          inspections - avg(inspections) over w1 as "distance from avg",
          first_value(inspections) over w2 as "max inspections per type",
          inspections - first_value(inspections) over w2 as "distance from top 1",
          dense_rank() over w2 as rank,
          (nth_value(inspections,1) over w3 / inspections::decimal)::numeric(18,1) as "rate to top 1",
          ntile(5) over w2 as ntile
  from failures_per_facility
  where facility_type = 'WHOLESALE'
  window
         w1 as (partition by facility_type, year),
         w2 as (partition by facility_type, year order by inspections desc),
         w3 as (partition by facility_type, year order by inspections desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following)
  limit 10;
#+END_SRC


** Hands-on
   Estimated time: 5 minutes
   Change the previous query to show the number of 'Fail' =results=
   instead the number of inspections.
   /Hint:/ Instead of using

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sql
  sum(
      case results
          when 'Fail'
          then 1
          else 0
      end
  ) as failures
#+END_EXAMPLE

   you can use =count(*) filter (where results = 'Fail')=

* Analytical Questions: Using the previous row

At a given date, number of days since the last inspection?


#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
          license_num,
          facility,
          date as inspection_date,
          lag(date, 1) over w1 as previous_inspection,
          age(date, lag(date,1) over w1) as time_since_last_inspection
          from semantic.inspections
          where facility = 'RAW'
          window w1 as (partition by license_num order by date asc)
#+END_SRC

* Analytical Questions: Using some other rows

Number of violations in the last 3 inspections

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  with violations as (
  select
          inspection,
          license_num,
          date,
          jsonb_array_elements(violations) as violations
  from semantic.inspections
  ),

  number_of_violations as (
  select
          inspection,
          license_num,
          date,
          count(*) as num_of_violations
  from violations
  group by inspection, license_num, date
  )

  select
          license_num,
          date,
          num_of_violations,
          sum(num_of_violations) over w,
          array_agg(num_of_violations) over w as previous_violations
  from number_of_violations
  where license_num = '1646652'
  window w as (partition by license_num order by date asc rows between 3 preceding and 1 preceding)

#+END_SRC

** Hands on
  Estimated time: 5 minutes
  - Which are the facilities with more changes in the =risk= column
    (i.e. lower -> medium, medium -> high, high -> medium)? Could you
    count how to many changes where "up" and how many where "down"?


#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  with risks as (
  select
          date,
          license_num,
          risk,
          lag(risk,1) over w as previous_risk
  from semantic.inspections
  window w as (partition by license_num order by date asc)
  )

  select
          extract(year from date) as year,
          license_num,
          count(case
               when risk = 'High' and previous_risk = 'Medium' then 1
               when risk = 'Medium' and previous_risk = 'Low' then 1
          end) as up,
          count(case
               when risk = 'Medium' and previous_risk = 'High' then 1
               when risk = 'Low' and previous_risk = 'Medium' then 1
          end) as down
  from risks
  where  license_num != '0'
  group by license_num, extract(year from date)
  order by year, up desc, down desc
  limit 10
#+END_SRC


* Meaning in text

Which are the most common words descriptions of the violations?

** Full Text Search

PostgreSQL' has a lot of capabilities for working with [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/textsearch.html][text data]]
(/fuzzy search/, /n-grams/, etc) that you can use for /searching inside/
the text.

But the same techniques allows you to do some text analysis. The first
steps of it are: removing stop words, stemming, calculating
frequencies and then /vectorization/.

See the following example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  select
         violation_comment as comment,
         replace(plainto_tsquery(violation_comment)::text, ' & ', ' ') as cleaned_comment,
         to_tsvector(violation_comment) as vectorized_comment
  from cleaned.violations limit 1;

#+END_SRC

Let's create a *word count* (from here you can create a word cloud, if
you like it). We will use the table =text_analysis.comments=

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
          regexp_split_to_table(cleaned_comment, '\s+') as word,
          count(1) as word_count
  from text_analysis.comments
  group by word
  order by word_count
  desc limit 50;
#+END_SRC


* Spatial awareness

Which restaurants with high risk are located near to public schools?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
          distinct on (license_num, facility, s.school_nm)
          license_num, facility, s.school_nm as "school"
  from gis.public_schools as s join semantic.inspections as i
       on ST_DWithin(geography(s.geom), geography(i.location), 200) -- This is the distance in meters
  where facility_type = 'RESTAURANT' and risk = 'High';
#+END_SRC

** Spatial queries

PostgresSQL has an extension called [[http://postgis.net/][PosGIS]], that allows you to do *Spatial Joins*, i.e. use geographical data
to answer questions as /What is near?/ /What is inside this area?/ /What intersects or connect with this?/

* Hands-on
  Estimated time: 5 min
  - There is another table: =gis.boundaries=, use the function
    =ST_Contains= to calculate the number of facilities per zip code?
    Compare that with the count using =zip_code= column in the
    =semantic.inspections=
    *Hint*: Use a CTE...

* Hands-on
  Estimated time: 10min
  - Generate a list with the top 5 facilities with the higher number of
    violations which are near to public schools

* Appendix

** Creating the database

First the =raw.inspections= table

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create schema if not exists raw;

  create table raw.inspections (
  inspection varchar not null,
  DBA_Name varchar,
  AKA_Name varchar,
  license_Num decimal,
  facility_type varchar,
  risk varchar,
  address varchar,
  city varchar,
  state varchar,
  zip varchar,
  date date,
  type varchar,
  results varchar,
  violations varchar,
  latitude decimal,
  longitude decimal,
  location varchar
  );
#+END_SRC

Then we fill that table with data

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  \copy raw.inspections from program 'curl "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/4ijn-s7e5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"' HEADER CSV
#+END_SRC

After that, we created a more "clean" version of the data

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
     create schema if not exists cleaned ;
