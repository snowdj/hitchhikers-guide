## Data Exploration and Analysis
Once you've got some data, you're going to be eager to dig into it! Our tool of choice for data analysis is Python. Start off 
with [Intro to Git and Python](intro-to-git-and-python/), then move onto [Data Exploration in Python](data-exploration-in-python/). 
If you're combining data from multiple sources, you'll have to do [record linkage](record-linkage/) to match entities across datasets. Depending on your particular project, you may need special methods and tools; at this time, we have resources 
for working with [text data](text-analysis/), [spatial data](gis_analysis/) and [network data](network-analysis/).
