## Getting and Keeping Data
Data comes in many forms, from many sources - you may get a database dump directly from a project partner,
or you may need to scrape data from the web (see [Basic Web Scraping](basic-web-scraping/)). Either way,
once you've got your hands on some data, you'll need to bring it into a [database](databases/),
and start formatting it in such a way that you can use it for analysis. You'll definitely want to keep track
of the steps you took to go from raw data to model-ready data ([Reproducible ETL](reproducible_ETL/)).
[Command Line Tools](command-line-tools/) will start to come in handy here. Often data science for social good 
projects will involve sensitive data, so it's important to be aware of some basic principles of data security:
